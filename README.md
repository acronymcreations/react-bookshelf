# MyReads Project

## Overview

This is a single-page application that organizes a user's books into three different
bookshelves, Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.  The user can easily move books
from shelf to shelf as well as search and add new books to a shelf.

## Quickstart

1. Clone this project to your local machine with the following command:

    `git clone https://github.com/acronymcreations/react-bookshelf.git`

2. Move into the project directory (`cd react-bookshelf`) and install the required
  packages with `npm install`

3. Start the react server by running `npm start`.  The project should automatically
  launch at <http://localhost:3000/>
